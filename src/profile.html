<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Haaris Chaudhry. I'm a junior studying computer science at KU. I was born and raised in Lawrence,
    KS.
    I spent four years in the United States Army as a combat medic. I'm a huge fan of eating unhealthy and taking naps.
    I like
    programming, reading about social issues, and going to the gym. Someday, I would like to pick up photography as a
    hobby and travel
    the world taking pictures of exotic places. I would also like to try out digital painting sometime in the
    future.</p>
